## Problem Statement
 > In software engineering it is often required to spin up VMs or bring up clusters. Setting up infrastructure is a pain. It involves typing in a lot of commands in the terminal and can sometimes become a repetitive task. Spinning up clusters for large scale data analytics or Machine learning is inherently complex, time consuming and tedious.
